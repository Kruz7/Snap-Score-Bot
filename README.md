### How to use

1. Install Python from <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.2/python-3.9.2-amd64.exe">here</a>. It is super important that checkbox `Add Python to PATH` is checked on setup.
2. After Python is installed, you need to install the required modules that are used for this script. 
3. Open the file called `Install Requirements.bat`. This will do everything for you with no issues, simple.
4. You will need to install an android emulator. I recommend <a href="https://www.bignox.com/">NoxPlayer</a>.
5. Download Snapchat on the android emulator and login.
6. On Snapchat app, make a shortcut with people you want to send snaps to.
7. Run the `main.py` script with Python. Follow the instructions
8. If you are confused, watch the YouTube video tutorial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZVj913gJ_k">here</a>
